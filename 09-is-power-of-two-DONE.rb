# Write a method that takes in a number and returns true if it is a
# power of 2. Otherwise, return false.
#
# You may want to use the `%` modulo operation. `5 % 2` returns the
# remainder when dividing 5 by 2; therefore, `5 % 2 == 1`. In the case
# of `6 % 2`, since 2 evenly divides 6 with no remainder, `6 % 2 == 0`.
#
# Difficulty: medium.

def is_power_of_two?(num)
    while num > 0
    if num == 1
      return true
    end
    num = num / 2.0 # becomes a problem because 78/2 repeatedly becomes 2.4 eventally, which rounds to 2. So use division by float 2.0 to have num be assigned the float 2.4, preventing the incorrect assignment to zero 
  end
  return false
